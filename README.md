# One Month Rails

This is the pinteresting sample application for 
[*One Month Rails*](http://onemonthrails.com)

I started the OneMonth Rails course a couple of months ago but got distracted with other work. Have returned to complete. Rather than take up where I left off I have essentially started again as much of what I did the first time I have forgotten.  That's why this repo is called pinteresting2.  It's the same project as pinteresting.
